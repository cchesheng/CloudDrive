A personal project for PHP practicing purpose.
With simplest raw PHP code, I try to use my knowledges as much as I can.
Here is a list of things I practiced in this project:
  1. Session and Cookie
  2. GET and POST methods
  3. String and regular expression
  4. PHP graphic processing methods
  5. Mixture of PHP and HTML
  6. Magic methods and constants

Other things want to use in the further development:
  1. Use mySQL to save account information
  2. Reconstruct with PHP Frameworks
  3. Better UI/UX design
  4. Consider security
  
The project was testing and running in a localhost environment that provided by WampServer.
